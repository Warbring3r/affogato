#Affogato [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/affogato.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/affogato)

Affogato is a custom JavaScript testing framework. It includes:

- MochaJS, which affogato uses as the test runner. Theoretically, affogato is test-runner agnostic and could support multiple test runners.
- SinonJS for spies, stubs, timers, and mocks
- ChaiJS assertion library
- JSDom to run the tests in a virtual (non-browser) environment
- XHR recorder that replays ajax requests for reliability and speed
- A debugger leveraging node-inspector
- Code coverage tracking and reporting using Istanbul

This project is still in development.
